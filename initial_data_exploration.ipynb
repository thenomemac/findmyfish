and clear following an extended dry period, although that looks like it could change with rain in the weekend forecast.\\u00a0 Any cool rain and subsequent rise in stream levels\\u00a0will serve to entice some steelhead into the streams.<br>\\r\\n<br>\\r\\nIn addition to steelhead- largemouth bass, smallmouth bass, panfish (rock bass and sunfish), freshwater drum and\\u00a0northern pike\\u00a0can be found along the Cleveland shoreline in\\u00a0early\\u00a0fall\\u00a0and can be caught on offerings such as tube jigs, crankbaits, dropshot rigs\\u00a0and live bait.\\u00a0 Nice catches of walleye (15-20 inches) have been found in water from only 16-24 feet deep by Cleveland area.\\u00a0 Shore based walleye anglers are doing best at dusk and after dark.\\u00a0 Walleye anglers offshore of Cleveland have been reporting outstanding catches in 60-70- feet of water.\\u00a0 White bass and ywllow perch fishing has been slow lately.\\u00a0 The ODNR Division

at\\u00a0Metroparks inland lakes and ponds are catching catfish, largemouth bass, and panfish.\\u00a0 Wallace Lake, Ledge Lake, Shadow Lake, and Beyer's Pond are a few spots worth poking around in

details).<br>\\r\\n<br>\\r\\n<strong><em>Coho Salmon Pilot Project <span style=\\\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);\\\">*UPDATE:\\u00a0 SALMON HAVE BEEN STOCKED!*\\u00a0</span></em></strong>\\u00a0\\u00a0 Due to the Cleveland Metroparks Fishing Fund doing well I have coordinated the purchase of coho salmon (1-2 pounds each) for release into Wallace Lake\\u00a0for a put-and-take fishery.\\u00a0 The fish, which are raised by a private Ohio fish farm (Homestead Farms), look similar to a rainbow trout but have subtle differences in spotting (larger and more irregular shaped spots on most fish), as well as a different look to the head and tail.\\u00a0 See several photos of the salmon stocked below.\\u00a0 On Wednesday October 4 we stocked 172 fish-\\u00a0 mostly coho salmon but a few rainbow trout were mixed in.\\u00a0 I plan to do a second stocking in the near future- possibly on Wednesday October 11 (stay tuned to the fishing report for updates).\\u00a0 Initial reports over the past day since the fish were released are that the salmon are biting more fickle than the trout, which is OK by me so that the fish can pose a slight challenge to anglers and last in the lake a bit longer.\\u00a0 The salmon hooked so far have been on small spoons and spinners.\\u00a0 There is a clearly posted limit of one salmon/trout per angler daily\\u00a0at the lake.\\u00a0 I request that anglers report their catches (ideally with photos) to me so that I can track the success of this project-\\u00a0 thank you!\\u00a0\\u00a0<br>\\r\\n<br>\\r\\n<strong><em>Fall Family Fishing Fest on Saturday October

I was as amazed to catch a walleye as the people were who were gathered around me.\\u00a0 I remember a gentleman said to me, 'is that a walleye??\\u00a0 Up this far??'\\u00a0 I am absolutely amazed at the diverse amount of species that are in the Cuyahoga river and the best part is it's only 10 minutes from my house.\\u00a0 So far I've caught about 8 smallmouth, 1 walleye, and 2 sheephead and I also had no idea that there were sheephead in the river. I guess I had never thought of the Cuyahoga River as being a viable fishing resource considering the less than desirable image of the river and it's illustrious history as an industrial waste dump.\\u00a0 For years in my travels around the area I've been asked my many fellow anglers and passersby if I ever fish the Cuyahoga and my answer was always, 'well in the winter when the Rock locks up and I'm really desperate, I'll try the route 82 dam, but other than that, no way.'\\u00a0 I can now say for sure that the past 2 weekends have completely changed my view of the Cuyahoga.\\u00a0 And the best part is the river is so long and there are so many great places to fish, that I have yet to run into anyone else, so the peace and quiet is a welcome bonus.\\u00a0 Well with the exception of the railroad tracks but I don't mind watching the trains at all.\\u00a0 The blog from a few weeks back (the kid with the 2 northern pike and some smallies) got me interested and the rest is history.\\\"</em> (photos courtesy of Tony Cilluffo).\\r\\n\\r\\n<div dir=\\\"ltr\\\" id=\\\"yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1507055491293_6681\\\">\\u00a0</div>\\r\\n<br>\\r\\n<img alt=\\\"\\\"

catfish and panfish.\\u00a0<br>\\r\\n<br>\\r\\nAlthough it has been very dry for several weeks running and local streams are very low and clear, accordingly, the return of cooler weather is being welcomed by steelhead anglers.\\u00a0 A mosest number of early steelhead continue showing up off the rocks at Edgewater and E55th, around the Rocky River marina, and off the breakwall at Wildwood Park.\\u00a0 Casting a spoon (ie Little Cleo or KO Wobbler) or spinner (ie Vibrax or RoosterTail) at these locations are as good a bet as any\\u00a0for connecting with an early steelhead trout, as is drifting a small jig tipped with minnow or maggots under a bobber.\\u00a0 Any cool rain in the coming weeks should serve to entice a more early steelhead into the streams.<br>\\r\\n<br>\\r\\nAnglers are also pursuing a mix of warmwater species in the streams.\\u00a0 Smallmouth bass being caught in deeper rocky pools of the river.\\u00a0 A dark olive or brown tube jig of about 4\\\" length is one of the best producers of bass in the river.\\u00a0 \\\"Smallies\\\" also bite well on live bait (ie: minnow, crayfish, and leeches), lures (ie: spinners and minnow plugs), and flies (ie: crayfish patterns, Clouser minnows, dark brown or olive sculpin or muddler minnow patterns).\\u00a0 Cannel catfish, carp,\\u00a0sheepshead and\\u00a0several panfish and sucker species\\u00a0are also present in some of these same areas in the river, especially around the marina.<br>\\r\\n<br>\\r\\nAnglers at our inland lakes and ponds are catching catfish, largemouth bass, and panfish.\\u00a0 Wallace Lake, Ledge Lake, Shadow Lake, and Beyer's Pond are a few spots worth poking around in late summer and early fall.<br>\\r\\n<br>\\r\\nIn addition to early steelhead- rock bass, largemouth bass, smallmouth bass, crappie, freshwater drum and\\u00a0sunfish species can be found along the Cleveland shoreline in summer and can be caught on offerings such as tube jigs, dropshot rigs\\u00a0and live bait.\\u00a0 Some good eater size walleye (15-20 inches) have been found in water from only 16-24 feet deep by Cleveland area boating and even shoreline anglers.\\u00a0 Walleye anglers offshore of Cleveland have been reporting outstanding catches in 60-70- feet of water.\\u00a0 White bass fishing, which is typically good in late summer, has been slow lately.\\u00a0 Yellow perch fishing off

Anglers have been making\\u00a0decent catches of fresh steelhead in the northernmost miles of the Rocky River and other area streams.\\u00a0\\u00a0The steelhead bite has remained good along the

sim,ilar through the weekend.\\u00a0Fair catches of steelhead were reported in the northern reaches of the Rocky River and other area tributaries.\\u00a0 The\\u00a0big trout, averaging 5-7 lbs as of late, are biting on brightly colored dime to nickel size spawn sacks, beads that mimic salmon eggs, small marabou jigs tipped with a few maggots or a waxworm drifted under a float, flies (egg patterns and baitfish streamers), and lures such as Little Cleo spoons and Vibrax spinners.\\u00a0 This is just the beginning as more steelhead can be expected to migrate into our streams following every cool rain that bumps stream flow.<br>\\r\\n<br>\\r\\nThe steelhead bite has remained very good along the Cleveland lakefront- especially at Edgewater Park and E55th east facing breakwall.\\u00a0 Steelhead are also showing up off the breakwall\\u00a0at E72nd, the pier at Wendy Park at the mouth of the Cuyahoga River, off the breakwall at Wildwood Park, and off the jetties at Huntington Beach.\\u00a0 Casting a spoon (ie Little Cleo or KO Wobbler) or spinner (ie Vibrax or RoosterTail) at these locations are as good a bet as any\\u00a0for connecting with a lakefront steelhead trout, as is\\u00a0suspending a small jig tipped with minnow or maggots under a bobber.\\u00a0 Make sure to bring a long handed landing net when fishing the lakefront for steelhead!<br>\\r\\n<br>\\r\\nIn addition to steelhead- largemouth bass, smallmouth bass, panfish (rock bass and sunfish), freshwater drum and\\u00a0northern pike\\u00a0can be found along the Cleveland shoreline in\\u00a0early\\u00a0fall\\u00a0and can be caught on offerings such as tube jigs, crankbaits, dropshot rigs\\u00a0and live bait.\\u00a0 Nice catches of walleye (15-20 inches) have been found in water from only 16-24 feet deep by Cleveland area.\\u00a0 Shore based walleye anglers are doing best at dusk and after dark.\\u00a0 White bass and yellow perch fishing has been slow lately.\\u00a0 The ODNR

Erie Canal fishing area off E49th Street (down the walking trail from Canalway Center) was stocked with 1,000 lbs of rainbow trout and 600 lbs of farm raised channel catfish last Friday.\\u00a0 The daily\\u00a0limit here is 5 trout per angler.\\u00a0 Trout bite well on PowerBait, small jigs tipped with maggots, and small spinners.\\u00a0 Catfish bite great on chicken liver.\\u00a0 Trout and catfish can both be targeted effectively fishing a half nightcrawler worm or chunk of cocktail shrimp right on the canal bottom.<br>\\r\\n<br>\\r\\nAnglers at\\u00a0Metroparks inland lakes and ponds are catching catfish, largemouth bass, and panfish.\\u00a0 Wallace Lake, Ledge Lake, Shadow Lake, and Beyer's Pond are a few spots worth poking around in late summer and early fall.\\u00a0 Wallace Lake was just stocked with catchable size coho salmon and a few rainbow trout this week (see highlight below for details).<br>\\r\\n<br>\\r\\n<strong><em>Coho Salmon Pilot Project.\\u00a0\\u00a0 </em></strong>Due to the Cleveland Metroparks Fishing Fund doing well we purchased coho salmon (1-2 pounds each) which were\\u00a0released into Wallace Lake\\u00a0for a put-and-take fishery.\\u00a0 The landlocked fish (meaning they can't migrate to Lake Erie), which are raised by a private\\u00a0local fish farm (Homestead Farms in Frederickstwon, Ohio), look similar to a rainbow trout but have subtle differences in spotting (larger and more irregular shaped spots on most fish), as well as a different look to the head and tail.\\u00a0\\u00a0 On October\\u00a04 &amp; 11\\u00a0we stocked\\u00a0300 fish-\\u00a0 mostly coho salmon but a few rainbow trout were also mixed in.\\u00a0 Reports are that the salmon are biting more fickle than the trout, which is OK by me so that the fish can pose a challenge to anglers and last in the lake a bit longer.\\u00a0 All the salmon I've heard about hooked so far have been on small flashy lures, namely\\u00a0small spoons and spinners.\\u00a0 There is a clearly posted limit of one salmon/trout per angler daily\\u00a0at the lake.\\u00a0 I request that anglers report their catches (ideally with photos) to me so that I can track the success of this project-\\u00a0 thank you!\\u00a0\\u00a0<br>\\r\\n<br>\\r\\n<em><strong>Fall Dockage Specials at E55th Marina.\\u00a0</strong></em>\\u00a0\\u00a0 As an FYI to late season Lake Erie fishing boaters, we are offering some fall specials on dockage at E55th Marina.\\u00a0 Dockage from November 1-30 is available for\\u00a0$150, or for $5/day (the latter of which includes remaining October dates).\\u00a0 There will be electric, but no water, during this time.\\u00a0 If interested call Lisa Buie at\\u00a0(216) 881-8141.<br>\\r\\n<br>\\r\\nIf you have a photo that you

streams\\u00a0include smallmouth bass, carp, panfish, channel catfish, and early returning steelhead trout.\\u00a0 The Rocky River\\u00a0level is flowing low with a light stain this morning, but we appear to have quite a bit of rain in the forecast into the weekend that could change that.\\u00a0 To monitor the most recent river water level and temperature you can check the following link:\\u00a0</span><span><a href=\\\"http://waterdata.usgs.gov/oh/nwis/uv?04201500\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"><strong><span><span>&lt;Rocky River flow gage data&gt;</span></span></strong></a><a

anglers are primarily pursuing largemouth bass, channel catfish and panfish.\\u00a0 <br> <br> A few anglers reported catching steelhead in the northern stretches of area rivers again this week, but water temperatures have been warm from a trout perspective.\\u00a0 When the water is\\u00a0above 70 deg F it is a good idea to get fish in\\u00a0and release them quickly, unless you plan to harvest them.\\u00a0 Early steelhead tend show up in the northern mile or so of all of our major streams, as well as off the rocks at Edgewater and E55th.\\u00a0 Casting a spoon (ie Little Cleo or KO Wobbler) or spinner (ie Vibrax or RoosterTail) at these locations are as good a bet as any\\u00a0for connecting with an early steelhead trout.\\u00a0 <span>Our first cool rain in the coming weeks should serve to entice a few more early steelhead into the streams.\\u00a0 As a point of interest</span>, several pink salmon, aka \\\"humpies\\\" due to the pronounced hump on the male fish's back, have turned up in our local streams this week.\\u00a0 These smallest of the salmon (the state record is only 3 lbs) are not stocked in the Lake Erie drainage and migrate down here\\u00a0as stray from the upper Great Lakes where they are fairly common.\\u00a0 For unknown reasons more of them appear to be present in Lake Erie this year.\\u00a0 These fish\\u00a0are among the earliest to run and they all die following spawning.<br> <br> Anglers are also pursuing a mix of warmwater species in the streams.\\u00a0 Smallmouth bass will bite a\\u00a0dark olive or brown tube jig of about 4?\\ufffd\\ufffd length, live bait (ie: minnow, crayfish, and leeches), spinners, smaller crankbaits, and flies (ie: crayfish patterns, Clouser minnows, dark brown or olive sculpin or muddler minnow patterns).\\u00a0 Channel catfish, carp,\\u00a0sheepshead and\\u00a0several sucker species\\u00a0can often be found\\u00a0around the marina on the Rocky.\\u00a0 Catfishing is usually best during lower light conditions using baits such as nightcrawlers, minnows, chicken liver, and processed dough baits.\\u00a0\\u00a0 Catfish often bite best following a rain when the water is a bit murky.\\u00a0 Carp can often be caught throughout the day on such bait as canned corn, carp dough baits, worms or crayfish tails.\\u00a0 For the angling generalist, any of the species thus far can be effectively targeted by fishing a nightcrawler worm right on the river bottom with a sinker.<br> <br> Anglers at our inland lakes and ponds are catching catfish, largemouth bass, and panfish.\\u00a0 Wallace Lake, Ledge Lake, Shadow Lake, and Beyer's Pond are a few spots worth poking around in late summer/early fall.<br> <br> The yellow perch bite has picked up this week following a slow summer and early fall.\\u00a0 Anglers are using perch spreaders and live or salted shiners, although emerald shiners have been hard to come by this year.\\u00a0 Boating anglers have found a few perch this week off\\u00a0Cleveland and Euclid in 32-40 feet of water.\\u00a0 Rock bass, largemouth bass, smallmouth bass, crappie, freshwater drum and\\u00a0sunfish species are also found along the Cleveland shoreline in summer and can be caught on offerings such as tube jigs, dropshot rigs\\u00a0and live bait.\\u00a0 Some good eating size walleye (15-20 inches) have been caught in water from only 16-24 feet deep by Cleveland area boating anglers.\\u00a0 White bass fishing, which is typically good in late summer, has been slow lately.\\u00a0 The ODNR Division of\\u00a0Wildlife\\u00a0weekly Lake Erie fishing report can be viewed

27.\\u00a0 The first was in 2011 and these surveys are on\\u00a0a 5 year cyclic effort.\\u00a0 In 2011 we sampled only 4 largemouth bass in 80 minutes of effort three of which were small 1-2 year old fish.\\u00a0 This indicated a serious predator shortage, which I suspected was from a combination of poor winter condition under the ice (winterkill) and heavy harvest.\\u00a0 Since then I made an effort to address this issue.\\u00a0 We have been proactively treating excess vegetation throughout the growing season to minimize low oxygen under the ice (as it decomposes).\\u00a0 Grass carp (one sampled\\u00a0Tuesday in above photos)\\u00a0were also restocked in the lake two years ago to help with this.\\u00a0 A nutrient input issue coming from an adjacent property was also dealt with successfully in 2011.\\u00a0 And bass have been regularly stocked in the lake since, the last time being on 11/4/15 (we wanted about a year of no bass stocking before this resurvey to get a feel for survival and recruitment).\\u00a0 Last winter was extremely mild but, as you'll recall, the winter prior to that was brutal.\\u00a0 I am pleased to report that our fish population survey Monday turned up 30 bass in on only 34 minutes of sampling, including the beauties in the photo above.\\u00a0 The same sampling equipment and procedure was used as in 2011.\\u00a0 And bass of all size classes were represented in the sampling, including several that would have been spawned in the lake this past spring.\\u00a0 I will be further processing the data this winter, but this initial observation is great news.</span></p> <span> </span>\\r\\n                \\u00a0\\r\\n<hr>\\r\\n<p>Note: The fishing report is updated monthly in June, July, and August and weekly every other

of fresh chrome and darker\\u00a0steelhead being caught today, with the fish averaging 4-6 pounds.\\u00a0 Today\\u00a0dime to nickel size spawn sacks of\\u00a0salmon or trout eggs in various colors drifted 4-6' below a float were taking most of the fish.\\u00a0 Although no one color was a standout, both pink and chatreuse colors were working well.\\u00a0 As the\\u00a0water continues to recede

(size 12-14 egg patterns and Wooly Buggers always seem to work well).\\u00a0 Slowly working a spinner, spoon or wobbling plug through a deep hole can also be a good change-up tactic in winter.\\u00a0 Fresh fish this morning were up to at least Morley Ford just north of the Lorain Road bridge, which is as far upstream as I checked the short time I got out.<br> <br> The lake was rough and muddy earlier this week, but once it settles down steelhead and walleye fishing opportunities\\u00a0will be\\u00a0available from the shore\\u00a0at Lakefront Reservation.\\u00a0 Anglers can view current

Although action has slowed over the past month, the east facing wall at East 55th Street access has still been producing some steelies.\\u00a0 When the shoreline rocks are not coated with ice anglers can also check Edgewater Park,\\u00a0Wildwood Park\\u00a0and Huntington Reservation for shore fishing access.\\u00a0 Anglers have been catching\\u00a0lakefront steelhead\\u00a0most consistently on an offering dubbed \\\"The Smorgasbord\\\" by the locals, which consists of a small 1/32 oz marabou jig or painted jighead tipped with several maggots and two or three small emerald shiners suspended a few feet under a bobber.\\u00a0\\u00a0Most walleye have been taken after dark off East 72nd Street/Gordon Park access on Husky Jerk, X-Rap, Rattlin Rogue and Rattle Trap crankbaits.\\u00a0 For both the walleye and steelhead shoreline fisheries, the action tends to come in spurts and anglers need to bring a long handled landing net and should be very careful and avoid ice covered shoreline rocks.\\u00a0 A set of ice cleats is a very good idea this time of year.\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0<br> <br> Earlier in December a\\u00a0total of 2,000 pounds of rainbow trout were stocked in five Cleveland Metroparks lakes.\\u00a0 The fish were distributed as follows:\\u00a0Wallace Lake (900#), Ledge Lake (500#), Shadow Lake (400#), Ranger Lake (100#), Judge's Lake (100#).\\u00a0 The trout range from 1-4 pounds, with about 10% of those stocked being a bright yellow\\u00a0variation of rainbow trout that are known as golden rainbows or \\u00a0\\\"palominos\\\".\\u00a0 Although ice is forming again following the thaw last week, it is not currently safe to venture onto.\\u00a0 In the meantime, anglers can target these trout from the safety of fishing platfoms and docks, as well as from deeper water from shore in several areas at Wallace Lake due to the former sandstone quarry\\u00a0nature of the lake.\\u00a0 Most state conservation agencies recommend at least 4\\\" of solid ice before anglers should venture out to ice fish.\\u00a0 Trout have been caught most consistently this week\\u00a0on PowerBait (chartreuse\\u00a0has been\\u00a0good)\\u00a0fished near the lake bottom with a small weight and small jigs tipped with a few maggots or a waxworm suspended under a small bobber.\\u00a0 Jigging spoons, such as gold or silver Forage Minnows and Kastmasters, worked near the lake bottom will take trout, as well.<br> </span><span><span><span><strong><em><br> </em></strong></span></span></span><span>If\\u00a0you have a photo or information that you would like to contribute

northern Rocky River on Friday afternoon and from the marina to the lake is currently open.\\u00a0 The river is dropping nicely, but the forecast for the coming week is calling for very cold temperatures which will lead to slush and ice.</em><span><em>***<br> </em></span></span><br> Highlight species targeted by anglers around Cleveland Metroparks in winter include stocked rainbow trout, steelhead and panfish.\\u00a0 All\\u00a0our lakes and ponds are offering ice fishing opportunities, as\\u00a0are protected harbors along the Lake Erie shoreline.\\u00a0 The Rocky and Chagrin rivers are expeced to begin breaking up and flooding\\u00a0due to\\u00a0the impending rain and thaw.\\u00a0 As the rivers open up, anglers can\\u00a0check the most recent river water level and temperature at the following links:\\u00a0</span><a href=\\\"http://waterdata.usgs.gov/oh/nwis/uv?04201500\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"><strong><span>&lt;Rocky River flow gage data&gt;</span></strong></a><span>\\u00a0

impending\\u00a0thaw and rain later today and into the weekend.\\u00a0\\u00a0It is difficult to predict\\u00a0if this will be enough to free ice jam from the river, especially by the marina.\\u00a0 Keep posted for updates.\\u00a0 At the time of this writing, the Rocky River is offering quite a bit of fishable water between the Nature Center and Purtias Road, with today likely offering the last opportunity to fish it in awhile.\\u00a0<br> <br> <span><span>Lake Erie shoreline\\u00a0ice fishing opportunities are\\u00a0available in protected areas, such as East 55th and Wildwood marinas and Gordon Park.\\u00a0 The thaw and rain should not be enough to do too much damage to the solid 12\\\"+ ice base in most areas, especially since tonight is the only night not projected to get below freezing.\\u00a0 But ice fishers should expect a sloppy mess on the ice with lots of slush and standing water, so wearing rubber boots or waders is a good plan.\\u00a0 Edgewater Marina access\\u00a0will be\\u00a0closed off at the launch ramps this winter for hurricane damage related repairs to the area, but motivated anglers can still walk in along the rip-rap to the west.\\u00a0 These areas offer steelhead and smelt, among other species like sunfish, crappie and even northern pike.\\u00a0 One angler at E 55th Marina over the weekend reported observing a pike well in excess of 40\\\" swim right by the hole he was fishing!\\u00a0 A single maggot on a tiny hook, or tandem hooks a foot apart, is a\\u00a0productive smelt offering.\\u00a0 The same baits as used in river fishing will work for steelies under the ice, as well as a jigging spoons.\\u00a0 The E 72nd area has huge schools of emerald shiners currently present, as evidenced by this <a href=\\\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91663_byO6I\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"><strong>&lt;video link&gt;</strong></a>.<br> <br> The final\\u00a0winter stocking of trout\\u00a0was completed on February 5th.\\u00a0 The stocking\\u00a0consisted of\\u00a0a\\u00a0total of 2,000 pounds of rainbow trout stocked as follows:\\u00a0Wallace Lake (900#), Ledge Lake (550#), Shadow Lake (300#), Ranger Lake (100#), Judge's Lake (150#).\\u00a0 Shadow Lake had a slighlty reduced stocking quantity due to less than ideal dissolved oxygen levels, with the extra trout distributed between the\\u00a0remaining lakes.\\u00a0 The trout range from 1-4 pounds, with about 10% of those stocked being a bright yellow\\u00a0variation of rainbow trout known as golden rainbows. <br> <br> <span>The trout bite at Wallace and Ledge\\u00a0lakes\\u00a0has been fair to good this week.\\u00a0 Despite some anglers noting slow fishing lately, I offer two examples to the contrary.\\u00a0 Lee, aka \\\"Possum\\\", a Wallace Lake regular has caught his three fish limit of trout every single day since we stocked the lake on January 31st, with the exception of getting skunked this past Monday.\\u00a0 Lee is\\u00a0absolutely lethal\\u00a0with those Kastmaster jigging spoons, with most of his fish lately biting about 4 feet down.\\u00a0 Frank, who has made the drive from Wellington\\u00a0to fish Wallace Lake thirteen\\u00a0times since December, has caught trout on 12 of those outings.\\u00a0 He usually averages 2-3 landed in a day of\\u00a0fishing (he quits when he gets his 3 trout limit) using tip-ups baited with either PowerBait or live minnows.\\u00a0 Among those trout\\u00a0Frank has landed a rainbow of 4 pounds and a golden rainbow of 3 pounds.\\u00a0 He has also caught several largemouth bass, up to 3 pounds, and several nice crappie on live minnows this winter.\\u00a0 As an interesting side note,\\u00a0Frank uses simple but effective antique tip-ups from the 1940s!\\u00a0 As both of these guys put it, they are happy the fish are biting well enough, but not so good that they are getting cleaned out in a few weeks.\\u00a0 I have recieved fewer reports from Shadow, Judges and Ranger\\u00a0\\u00a0lakes, and the ones I have recieved indicate the trout bite at these locations seems to be fair at best.\\u00a0\\u00a0The\\u00a0severe winter we are having this year with extended ice cover and snow is causing oxygen levels to decline in our lakes and ponds, which is likely the reason\\u00a0the trout can be in a sour mood.\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0 <br> <br> </span>Jigging spoons, like 1/4-1/2 oz Swedish Pimples and Kastmasters in silver and gold finishes have been top trout producers again this week.\\u00a0 Give the lure an upward pump of 6-12\\\" and most fish are hitting as it flutters on the drop.\\u00a0 Most experienced anglers do not tip these spoons with bait, although you can add a single waxworm.\\u00a0 Other good\\u00a0offerings for trout include PowerBait fished near the bottom, dime size spawn sacks, and small jigs\\u00a0tipped with maggots or a waxworm suspended below a small bobber.\\u00a0\\u00a0One common mistake I see is folks using

rivers\\u00a0are currently very limited\\u00a0due to slush and ice, and given the forecast there is no immediate end in sight.\\u00a0 Up until the latest freeze, anglers had been\\u00a0catching steelhead between Thursday and Tuesday, with spawn sacks and jigs drifted under floats being top producers.\\u00a0 A highlight has been a few more stray brown trout mixed in (see photos below).\\u00a0\\u00a0An option worth a look at the moment is the Cuyahoga River, which is slower to freeze up in winter than some of our other streams.\\u00a0 Overall, the steelhead run this fall and winter has been below average in area streams according to most anglers; opinions, and lets hope the spring run makes up for that.<br> <br> <span>Steelhead and walleye fishing opportunities\\u00a0are available from the shore\\u00a0at Lakefront Reservation depending on wave conditions.\\u00a0 Anglers can view current lake conditions off Cleveland at the following link: </span><a href=\\\"http://webcam.clevelandcrib.org/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"><strong><span>&lt;City Of Cleveland Water Intake Crib Cam&gt;</span></strong></a><span>.\\u00a0 Although action has slowed over the past month, the east facing wall at East 55th Street access has still been producing some steelies.\\u00a0 When the shoreline rocks are not coated with ice anglers can also check Edgewater Park,\\u00a0Wildwood Park\\u00a0and Huntington Reservation for shore fishing access.\\u00a0 Anglers have been catching\\u00a0lakefront steelhead\\u00a0most consistently on an offering dubbed \\\"The Smorgasbord\\\" by the locals, which consists of a small 1/32 oz marabou jig or painted jighead tipped with several maggots and two or three small emerald shiners suspended a few feet under a bobber.\\u00a0\\u00a0Most walleye have been taken after dark off East 72nd Street/Gordon Park access on Husky Jerk, X-Rap, Rattlin Rogue and Rattle Trap crankbaits.\\u00a0 For both the walleye and steelhead shoreline fisheries, the action tends to come in spurts and anglers need to bring a long handled landing net and should be very careful and avoid ice covered shoreline rocks.\\u00a0 A set of ice cleats is a very good idea this time of year.</span><br> <br> On the other hand, ice fishers are excited about the forecast.\\u00a0 Athough anglers are not on the ice\\u00a0quite yet, the forecast leading into the weekend is promising.\\u00a0 To enhance ice fishing opportunities, in early\\u00a0December a\\u00a0total of 2,000 pounds of rainbow trout were stocked in five Cleveland Metroparks lakes.\\u00a0 The fish were distributed as follows:\\u00a0Wallace Lake (900#), Ledge Lake (500#), Shadow Lake (400#), Ranger Lake (100#), Judge's Lake (100#).\\u00a0 The trout range from 1-4 pounds, with about 10% of those stocked being a bright yellow\\u00a0variation of rainbow trout that are known as golden rainbows or \\u00a0\\\"palominos\\\".\\u00a0 Trout have been biting on PowerBait fished near the bottom, small jigs tipped with maggots or a waxworm suspended below a small bobber and jigging spoons (smaller size KastMaster, Forage Minnow and Swedish Pimple have all been producing).\\u00a0 For those interested in getting into ice fishing, I will be offering free ice fishing basics seminars as part of our Winterffic event this Sunday January 5.\\u00a0 These free offerings will be\\u00a0from 1:30-2:30pm and 3:00-4:00pm at\\u00a0Wallace Lake at the swimming area.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 <br> <br> Most state conservation agencies recommend at least 4\\\" of solid ice before anglers should venture out to ice fish, and in Cleveland Metroparks it is the angler's responsibility to check that.\\u00a0 One method is to drill a hole near shore and check the ice thickness, and if it is <u>&gt;</u> 4 inches then walk out a little further and check again.\\u00a0 Ice is often thinnest right at the water's edge and around inlets and outlets\\u00a0of the waterbody.\\u00a0 Other safety tips are to always fish with a friend, let someone know where you'll be,\\u00a0and focus on areas near where other anglers are already fishing.\\u00a0 <br> <br> <em><strong>Our Fishery Through The Eyes Of a German Visitor.</strong></em>\\u00a0\\u00a0 Cem Pahl (pronounced \\\"Gem\\\") is from Berlin, Germany, and was visiting the U.S. with his American girlfriend for the holidays last week.\\u00a0 Cem is a serious angler, and regularly wets a line in the waters of Germany, Spain and Sweden.\\u00a0 Fortunately for him, he has a connection through friends with veteran local steelheader Mike Spanulo.\\u00a0 Last Friday and Saturday Mike took Cem out on the Rocky for a few hours each day, and Cem was elated to land 7 steelhead under Mike's tutelage (a few photos are included below).\\u00a0 Cem is a biologist by profession in Germany, so Mike figured I'd like to meet him so they stopped by my office on Monday morning and the following are Cem's observations.<br> <br> Cem had a hard time even wrapping his mind around the concept of a publicly owned\\u00a0fishing area.\\u00a0 In Germany, he relayed, all rivers and streams are privately owned.\\u00a0 In <em>each</em> German province, the prospective angler needs to take and pass an angler education course <em>just for the privilege of purchasing a fishing license</em>.\\u00a0 Cem produced a few passport-like examples of the approval that is issued upon completion from the different provinces.\\u00a0 Then, the next step is to purchase a fishing license for a very specific (and limited) river segment or waterbody.\\u00a0 And get this, <em>the license is purchased from the commercial fishermen</em> who own the fishing rights.\\u00a0 Yes, in Germany you pay to sport fish the same areas also netted by commercial operations.\\u00a0 I hope this makes you all feel as fortunate as it does me that we have the freedom to fish like we\\u00a0do here in America!\\u00a0 Cem was certainly impressed.<br> <br> <strong><em>Ice Fishing Photo Contest.</em></strong>\\u00a0 <span>Scott MacDougall wanted to let local anglers know about his Angler &amp; Hunter Ice Fishing Photo Contest, which

Panfish and bass tend to be more structure oriented\\u00a0in winter than trout.<br> <br> Ohio and Cleveland Metroparks regulations allow two rods and six tip-ups per angler on the ice.\\u00a0 Since the Ohio regs pamphlet does not define\\u00a0a tip-up in detail, some confusion exists among anglers as to what constitutes such a device, so I offer the following clarification.\\u00a0 <span>The Ohio Administrative Code definition\\u00a0of a tip-up per 1501:31-1-02 (EEEEE) is as follows: <em>\\\"Tip-up means a device consisting of a hook and line attached to a spring or other device which is capable of raising a small flag or other signaling device when a fish is biting or is hooked.?\\ufffd\\ufffd</em></span><em>\\u00a0</em>\\u00a0Please be aware of this because we've recieved a few complaints about anglers using non-legal versions of tip-ups recently, and our Rangers will be out checking.<br> </span></span></span></span></span></p> <p align=\\\"justify\\\"><span><span><span style='font-family: \\\"Arial\\\",\\\"sans-serif\\\";

Panfish and bass tend to be more structure oriented\\u00a0in winter than trout.<br> <br> Ohio and Cleveland Metroparks regulations allow two rods and six tip-ups per angler on the ice.\\u00a0 Since the Ohio regs pamphlet does not define\\u00a0a tip-up in detail, some confusion exists among anglers as to what constitutes such a device, so I offer the following clarification.\\u00a0 <span>The Ohio Administrative Code definition\\u00a0of a tip-up per 1501:31-1-02 (EEEEE) is as follows: <em>\\\"Tip-up means a device consisting of a hook and line attached to a spring or other device which is capable of raising a small flag or other signaling device when a fish is biting or is hooked.?\\ufffd\\ufffd</em></span><em>\\u00a0</em>\\u00a0Please be aware of this because we've recieved a few complaints about anglers using non-legal versions of tip-ups recently, and our Rangers will be out checking.<br> <br> Although ice is as good as it's been in several years on local lakes, caution should always be advised.\\u00a0 It's always a good idea to use a spud bar\\u00a0near shore and check the ice thickness, and if it is <u>&gt;</u> 4 inches then walk out a little further and check as you go.\\u00a0 Ice is often thinnest right at the water's edge and around inlets and outlets\\u00a0of the waterbody.\\u00a0 Other safety tips are to always fish with a friend, let someone know where you'll be,\\u00a0carry a pair of ice spikes around your neck and focus on areas near where other anglers are already fishing.<br> <br> <strong><em>Bonus Brown Trout

ice\\u00a0and water level and stain is looking good for weekend steelheaders.\\u00a0 Even though the river was still muddy yesterday, I recieved a few reports of steelhead being caught on pink spawn sacks, and conditions will only improve in the coming days.\\u00a0 Anglers should be aware that ice slabs stacked up on the riverbank can pose a challenge in getting to the water in some areas, especially around the marina (see photos below).\\u00a0 Please navigate these areas with caution.\\u00a0 Also, be prepared for some slush ice and ice in rod guides as the temperatures continue to drop, especially in the mornings.\\u00a0 In addition to dime size spawn sacks, good bets for winter steelhead include 1/32-1/64oz marabou jigs tipped with maggots or a waxworm, 3-4\\\" white tube jigs or Gulp minnows, and live minnows.\\u00a0 Fly fishers in winter often do well on egg patterns and Wooly Bugger or Egg Sucking Leech patterns, as well as nymphs as the water gets clear.<br> <br> <span>Lake Erie shoreline open water fishing opportunities are no longer\\u00a0available due to pack ice pushed up along the shoreline and a dangerous coating of ice covering shoreline structures.\\u00a0 On the other hand, solid ice is setting up in protected nearshore areas, such as East 55th and Wildwood marinas and Gordon Park.\\u00a0 Edgewater Marina access\\u00a0will be\\u00a0closed off this winter for hurricane damage repairs to the area.\\u00a0 These areas offer ice fishing opportunities for smelt and steelhead, among other species,\\u00a0which will heat up as winter progresses.<br> </span><br> Ice fishers have noted the fishing has slowed this week with the fronts moving through.\\u00a0 Ice fishing will get a big boost next Tuesday and Wednesday (January 21 and 22), though, when we conduct our second (and final) round of winter trout stocking.\\u00a0 This activity is subject to change based on weather, though, and anglers can check back in on the fishing report those days for updates.\\u00a0 The stocking will be a duplicate of the one\\u00a0conducted in early\\u00a0December with a\\u00a0total of 2,000 pounds of rainbow trout stocked as follows:\\u00a0Wallace Lake (900#), Ledge Lake (500#), Shadow Lake (400#), Ranger Lake (100#), Judge's Lake (100#).\\u00a0 The trout range from 1-4 pounds, with about 10% of those stocked being a bright yellow\\u00a0variation of rainbow trout that are known as golden rainbows or \\u00a0\\\"palominos\\\".\\u00a0 <br> <br> Trout have been biting on PowerBait fished near the bottom, small jigs tipped with maggots or a waxworm suspended below a small bobber and jigging spoons (smaller size KastMaster, Forage Minnow and Swedish Pimple have all been producing).\\u00a0\\u00a0For anglers looking for species in addition to trout,\\u00a0bluegill have also been caught on small ice spoons tipped with maggots or a waxworm, and\\u00a0some largemouth bass have been taken on jigging spoons.\\u00a0Both of these species tend to be more structure oriented\\u00a0in winter than trout.<br> <br> Ohio and Cleveland Metroparks regulations allow two rods and six tip-ups per angler on the ice.\\u00a0 Since the Ohio regs pamphlet does not define\\u00a0a tip-up in detail, some confusion exists among anglers as to what constitutes such a device, so I offer the following clarification.\\u00a0 <span>The Ohio Administrative Code definition\\u00a0of a tip-up per 1501:31-1-02 (EEEEE) is as follows: <em>\\\"Tip-up means a device consisting of a hook and line attached to a spring or other device which is capable of raising a small flag or other signaling device when a fish is biting or is hooked.?\\ufffd\\ufffd</em></span><em>\\u00a0</em>\\u00a0Please be aware of this because we've recieved a few complaints about anglers using non-legal versions of tip-ups recently, and our Rangers will be out checking.<br> <br> Most state conservation agencies recommend at least 4\\\" of solid ice before anglers should venture out to ice fish, and in Cleveland Metroparks it is the angler's responsibility to check that.\\u00a0 One method is to\\u00a0use a spud bar\\u00a0near shore and check the ice thickness, and if it is <u>&gt;</u> 4 inches then walk out a little further and check again.\\u00a0 Ice is often thinnest right at the water's edge and around inlets and outlets\\u00a0of the waterbody.\\u00a0 Other safety tips are to always fish with a friend, let someone know where you'll be,\\u00a0and focus on areas near where other anglers are already fishing.\\u00a0 <br> <br> <em><strong>US Army Corps of Engineers </strong></em><span><span><span><em><strong>Meeting Tonight About Asian Carp.</strong></em>\\u00a0\\u00a0 <span>Anglers have an

trout stocked as follows:\\u00a0Wallace Lake (900#), Ledge Lake (500#), Shadow Lake (400#), Ranger Lake (100#), Judge's Lake (100#).\\u00a0 The trout range from 1-4 pounds, with about 10% of those stocked being a bright yellow\\u00a0variation of rainbow trout known as golden rainbows. <br> <br> <span>Ice fishers have noted\\u00a0slower fishing\\u00a0this week.\\u00a0\\u00a0</span>Good\\u00a0offerings for trout include PowerBait fished near the bottom, dime size spawn sacks, small jigs\\u00a0tipped with maggots or a waxworm suspended below a small bobber and jigging spoons (smaller size KastMaster, Forage Minnow and Swedish Pimple have all been producing).\\u00a0\\u00a0One common mistake I see is folks using bobbers too big to adequately detect light winter bites, requiring one only big enough to keep the bait afloat (see photo of my preferred choices below).\\u00a0 For anglers looking for species in addition to trout,\\u00a0bluegill have also been caught on small ice spoons tipped with maggots or a waxworm, and\\u00a0some largemouth bass have been taken on jigging spoons. Panfish and bass tend to be more structure oriented\\u00a0in winter than trout.<br> <br> Ohio and Cleveland Metroparks regulations allow two rods and six tip-ups per angler on the ice.\\u00a0 Since the Ohio regs pamphlet does not define\\u00a0a tip-up in detail, some confusion exists among anglers as to what constitutes such a device, so I offer the following clarification.\\u00a0 <span>The Ohio Administrative Code definition\\u00a0of a tip-up per 1501:31-1-02 (EEEEE) is as follows: <em>\\\"Tip-up means a device consisting of a hook and line attached to a spring or other device which is capable of raising a small flag or other signaling device when a fish is biting or is hooked.?\\ufffd\\ufffd</em></span><em>\\u00a0</em>\\u00a0Please be aware of this because we've recieved a few complaints about anglers using non-legal versions of tip-ups recently, and our Rangers will be out checking.<br> <br> Although ice is as good as it's been in several years on local lakes, caution should always be advised.\\u00a0 It's always a good idea to use a spud bar\\u00a0near shore and check the ice thickness, and if it is <u>&gt;</u> 4 inches then walk out a little further and check as you go.\\u00a0 Ice is often thinnest right at the water's edge and around inlets and outlets\\u00a0of the waterbody.\\u00a0 Other safety tips are to always fish with a friend, let someone know where you'll be,\\u00a0carry a pair of ice spikes around your neck and focus on areas near where other anglers are already fishing.\\u00a0 With that said, a small car lost control\\u00a0on Saturday morning and veered onto Shadow Lake...and did not even break through the ice!\\u00a0<br> <br> <em><strong>Cleveland Museum of Natural History Trout Club Fly Fishing Film

throughout the winter, especially during winters with extended ice and snow cover and in shallow weedy lakes or those with abundant algae.\\u00a0 The oxygen is depleted as these plants/algae die and decompose.\\u00a0 This\\u00a0can be a\\u00a0normal, natural\\u00a0occurrence in certain environments, and/or can be exacerbated through surrounding human activities that contribute nutrients to a watershed, therby increasing vegetative growth.\\u00a0\\u00a0Cleveland Metroparks\\u00a0routinely monitors disslolved oxygen levels under the ice at a number of locations to assist with lake management decision making,\\u00a0such as determining roughly\\u00a0how many trout to stock per acre and where to focus summer vegetation management activities.\\u00a0\\u00a0Waters in\\u00a0descending order from highest to lowest oxygen levels are Ledge Lake, Wallace Lake, Ranger Lake, Judge's Lake, Shadow Lake and Oxbow Lagoon.\\u00a0 Shadow Lake had an oxygen depletion related fish kill\\u00a0in late winter 2011, and I would not be surprised at this rate if we don't see some dead fish at Oxbow Lagoon when the ice melts.\\u00a0 As a tip to anglers, winter oxygen levels in most lakes are highest near the surface and lowest down deeper, so don't be afraid to fish\\u00a0closer to the surface if you're not getting action near the bottom.</p> <p></p>\\r\\n

expertise that brought Matt to the Cleveland area for a talk to a group of saltwater enthusiasts at our Zoo last Friday evening.\\u00a0 </span><span>While in town Matt and I, along with a small group of similarly fish minded\\u00a0friends, planned to hit the ice for a bit of trout fishing.\\u00a0 Matt had observed photos of the unique golden rainbow trout being caught locally in the Fishing Report Blog as well as posted by friends on Facebook, and expressed that he would love to catch one himself.\\u00a0 <br> <br> So our goal was set.\\u00a0 On Saturday afternoon we headed to the Wallace Lake just off the swimming beach area in water about 6 feet deep.\\u00a0 As it turned out attaining that goal didn't take long.\\u00a0 Within the first hour on the ice Matt landed a healthy golden rainbow on a dime size pink spawn sack, followed by a regular rainbow.\\u00a0 A short while later he reported that he missed a light strike then looked down the hole and saw an unmistakably bright yellow trout swim by, only to drop his bait back down the hole to watch the trout rush back and grab it right in front of him!\\u00a0 He landed that one, as well.\\u00a0 All said, we landed four trout and missed a handful of others.\\u00a0 We also observed several other anglers catch trout, including a mother and son who came out for the last hour of the day and each landed a trout.\\u00a0 Most fish that day were taken on PowerBait and spawn sacks set between 3-6 feet deep.\\u00a0 All in all it was a very pleasant evening on the ice.\\u00a0 Mission accomplished!\\u00a0 Photos from the afternoon

       "                <div style=\"text-align: justify;\">The fishing report is being offered a day early this week due to the Holiday.  In fall highlight species targeted by anglers in Cleveland Metroparks include steelhead, walleye, and stocked rainbow trout and landlocked coho salmon (the latter recently stocked in Wallace Lake).  The Rocky River and other area streams are just dropping back into nice shape after being elevated and muddy since the weekend and can be expected to have plenty of fresh run steelhead available.  There is weekend rain in the forecast so area streams can be expected to continue dropping and clearing into the holiday weekend. Lake Erie has been kicked up and rough much of this week, but when conditions are amenable steelhead and walleye night bite has been very good along the Cleveland lakefront.  To monitor the most recent river water level and temperature you can check the following link: <strong><a href=\"http://waterdata.usgs.gov/oh/nwis/uv?04201500\" target=\"_blank\"><font color=\"#000080\">&lt;Rocky River flow gage data&gt;</font></a> <a href=\"http://waterdata.usgs.gov/oh/nwis/uv?site_no=04209000\" target=\"_blank\"><font color=\"#000080\">&lt;Chagrin River flow gage data&gt;</font></a></strong> <a href=\"https://wqdatalive.com/public/177\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><font color=\"#000080\">&lt;Rocky River NEORSD station with turbidity&gt;</font></strong></a>.<br>\r\n",
       "<br>\r\n",
       "Great news for anglers who have a tradition of sneaking out for a bit of Thanksgiving morning steelhead fishing!  The Rocky River and other area streams are dropping into perfect shape after being elevated and muddy for days and steelhead fishing prospects are excellent into the holiday weekend.  Steelhead are becoming progressively more spread throughout the systems with fish now throughout the entire mainstem of the Rocky River as well as both branches.  The big trout, averaging 5-7 lbs as of late, have been biting on brightly colored dime to nickel size spawn sacks when the water is stained, and beads that mimic salmon eggs, small marabou jigs tipped with a few maggots or a waxworm drifted under a float, flies (egg patterns and baitfish streamers), and lures such as Little Cleo spoons and Vibrax spinners as the water clears further.  The fall run is kicking into high gear with from Thanksgiving onward historically offering some of the best steelhead fishing of the season for hardy anglers that can handle the cold.<br>\r\n",
       "<br>\r\n",
       "The big lake has been rough most of this week, but the steelhead bite has remained very good along the Cleveland lakefront as lake wave conditions allow- especially at Edgewater Park and E55th east facing breakwall.  Steelhead can also be found off the breakwall at E72nd, the pier at Wendy Park at the mouth of the Cuyahoga River, off the breakwall at Wildwood Park, and off the jetties at Huntington Beach.  Casting a spoon (ie Little Cleo or KO Wobbler) or spinner (ie Vibrax or RoosterTail) at these locations are as good a bet as any for connecting with a lakefront steelhead trout, as is suspending a small jig tipped with minnow or maggots under a bobber.  Make sure to bring a long handed landing net when fishing the lakefront for steelhead!<br>\r\n",
       "<br>\r\n",
       "Complementing the great steelhead fishing along the Ceveland shoreline, excellent numbers of walleye have been found along nearshore Lake Erie.  Shore based walleye anglers are doing best casting stickbaits (ie- Husky Jerks and Perfect 10s) and glow in the dark spoons at dusk and after dark.  White bass and yellow perch fishing has been slow lately.  The ODNR Division of Wildlife weekly Lake Erie fishing report can be viewed <strong><a href=\"http://wildlife.ohiodnr.gov/fishing/fishing-forecasts-and-reports/the-fish-ohio-report\" target=\"_blank\"><font color=\"#000080\">&lt;here&gt;</font></a>.   </strong>Anglers/boaters can view current lake conditions off Cleveland at the following link: <strong><a href=\"http://webcam.clevelandcrib.org/\" target=\"_blank\"><font color=\"#000080\">&lt;City Of Cleveland Water Intake Crib Cam&gt;</font></a>.</strong><br>\r\n",
       "<br>\r\n",
       "The Ohio &amp; Erie Canal fishing area off E49th Street (down the walking trail from Canalway Center) was stocked with 1,000 lbs of rainbow trout and 600 lbs of farm raised channel catfish on Friday Octover 13th.  The daily limit here is 5 trout per angler.  Trout bite well on PowerBait, small jigs tipped with maggots, and small spinners.  Catfish bite great on chicken liver.  Trout and catfish can both be targeted effectively fishing a half nightcrawler worm or chunk of cocktail shrimp right on the canal bottom.<br>\r\n",
       "<br>\r\n",
       "Anglers at Metroparks inland lakes and ponds are catching catfish, largemouth bass, and panfish.  Wallace Lake, Ledge Lake, Shadow Lake, and Beyer's Pond are a few spots worth poking around in fall.  Oxbow Lagoon in Rocky River Reservation was stocked with 986 largemouth bass and bluegill, and Wallace Lake was stocked with the majority of 449 largemouth bass and bluegill on four days since October 23.  These fish were transferred from a private golf course lake that is being drained, and additionally Wallace recieved 300 catchable size coho salmon and a few rainbow trout back in October.  Rainbow trout will be stocked in Metroparks lakes around mid-December-  stay tuned to the fishing report for details on that.<br>\r\n",

       "<em><strong>Karma On The River. </strong></em>   Ray Lancaster is a guy I'd describe simply as a \"good dude\".  He is always friendly, has volunteered his time to help with the Barbie Rod Steelhead Derby Fundraiser, and is always willing to go out of his way to teach a \"newbie\" floatfisher how to cast a centerpin reel.  Last week he was fishing the Rock and struck up a conversation with Tim Fischer (the guy who submitted a photo of a coho salmon for this report last week).  Upon chatting they realized all three of us are mutual friends.  Ray moved on to a new spot and later Tim noticed a nice Buck knife on the ground that he suspected might belong to Ray.  Tim didn't have Ray's contact info so reached out to me, and I confirmed it was indeed Ray's fishing knife and Tim dropped it off at my office last week.  As it sat on my office desk Owen Lockhart, who works for me, noticed it was dull and a bit grimy (as fishing knives tend to be).  Over the weekend Owen took the knife home to clean and sharpen it knowing Ray is a stand-up guy.  Ray picked up his knife at my office this morning (see photo below) after spending the morning on the water teaching a younger 'pinner how to cast.  The moral of this story: what comes around goes around!<br>\r\n",

       "An Atlantic salmon was caught in a Lake Erie tributary to the west of Cleveland yesterday (top photo).  The young angler, who caught it on a silver crankbait, didn't know what species it was but thought it might be a coho salmon.  This is in fact a super rare catch in Erie.  The adipose fin clip indicates it was stocked in Lake Huron in Michigan.  Adding to the story, Michigan DNR netted an Atlantic salmon in the Detroit River (not far from Lake Erie) two days ago- bottom image.  If you would report any unique catches to me, especially with accompanying photos and details, it is always appreciated (photos Rae King and Michigan DNR, respectively).<br>\r\n",
